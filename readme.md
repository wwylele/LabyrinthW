## How to play

Move cursor to tilt the board and guide the marble to go around obstacles and reach the goal (the hole marked with checkerboard pattern).

## Used technique

 - Texture mapping
 - Shadow mapping
 - Spheres and cylinders generated by shader
   - The trick is to render a bounding box, and in the fragment shader, rays are casted and the intersection test is made with the sphere/cylinder, to determine whether to drop the fragment or not, and to determine the actual intersection position and normal.
